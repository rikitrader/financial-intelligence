## OIC ANALYSIS

### Doubt as to Collectibility (DATC)

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| RCP | $241,450 (lump sum) |
| Tax Liability | $45,000 |
| RCP vs Liability | RCP > Liability |
| **DATC Viable?** | **NO** |

The IRS will not accept a DATC offer because the taxpayer's RCP significantly exceeds the tax liability.

### Doubt as to Liability (DATL)

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| Legitimate dispute? | Possibly (CP2000 issues) |
| Evidence available? | Yes |
| Better forum? | Tax Court |
| **DATL Viable?** | **UNLIKELY** |

DATL is generally better addressed through audit reconsideration or Tax Court.

### Effective Tax Administration (ETA)

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| Economic hardship? | No |
| Exceptional circumstances? | No |
| Public policy? | No |
| **ETA Viable?** | **NO** |

---

## ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES

### Recommended: Installment Agreement

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly Disposable | $8,050 |
| Tax Liability | $45,000 |
| Months to Full Pay | ~6 months |
| Interest Cost | ~$1,500 |

**Analysis:** Taxpayer can fully pay within 6 months. Installment agreement is the appropriate resolution.

### Full Pay

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cash Available | $21,250 |
| From Investments | $23,750 |
| Total Available | $45,000 |
| **Full Pay Possible?** | **YES** |

---

## RECOMMENDATION

### Primary Recommendation: **INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT**

1. Taxpayer has ability to full pay within Collection Statute
2. OIC will be rejected (RCP > Liability)
3. 6-month installment plan minimizes interest

### Payment Plan

| Month | Payment | Running Total |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | $8,050 | $8,050 |
| 2 | $8,050 | $16,100 |
| 3 | $8,050 | $24,150 |
| 4 | $8,050 | $32,200 |
| 5 | $8,050 | $40,250 |
| 6 | $6,250 | $46,500* |

*Includes estimated interest accrual

### Alternative: Negotiate Liability First

Before agreeing to pay:
1. Pursue CP2000 response for income issues
2. Request penalty abatement
3. Challenge procedural violations

**Potential Liability Reduction:**
- If Issue 1 wins: -$5,250 (tax on $25,000)
- If Issue 2 wins: -$5,775 (tax on $27,500)
- Penalty abatement: -$2,205
- **Maximum reduction: $13,230**

---

## CONCLUSION

| Option | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| OIC - DATC | NOT RECOMMENDED |
| OIC - DATL | NOT RECOMMENDED |
| OIC - ETA | NOT RECOMMENDED |
| Installment Agreement | **RECOMMENDED** |
| Full Pay (After Challenge) | **BEST OPTION** |

**The taxpayer should:**
1. Challenge the underlying liability first
2. Request penalty abatement
3. Pay reduced amount or enter installment agreement
