## V. Findings

### Finding 1: Currency Structuring Pattern

**Opinion:** Based on my analysis, it is my opinion that the cash deposit pattern observed constitutes potential structuring under 31 U.S.C. § 5324.

**Facts:**
- January 18, 2024: Cash deposit $9,999.00 (Ref: CASH001)
- January 19, 2024: Cash deposit $9,998.00 (Ref: CASH002)
- January 20, 2024: Cash deposit $9,997.00 (Ref: CASH003)
- February 12, 2024: Cash deposit $9,999.00 (Ref: CASH004)

**Analysis:**
The probability of four deposits on three consecutive days (and one additional) all falling within $3 of the $10,000 CTR threshold by chance is less than 0.01%. The pattern is consistent with intentional structuring to avoid currency transaction reporting.

**Basis for Opinion:**
- Statistical improbability of coincidence
- Consistent with FinCEN structuring typology
- No documented business purpose for cash operations
- Same individual (rjones) conducted all deposits

---

### Finding 2: Unauthorized Offshore Transfers

**Opinion:** Based on my analysis, three wire transfers to Offshore Holdings Ltd violated corporate policy and exhibit characteristics of suspicious activity.

**Facts:**
- January 20, 2024: Wire $9,500.00 to Cayman National Bank
- February 5, 2024: Wire $9,400.00 to Cayman National Bank
- February 20, 2024: Wire $9,300.00 to Cayman National Bank

**Analysis:**
Corporate policy (EX-103) requires board approval for all foreign transfers. No evidence of board authorization was provided. The descending amount pattern suggests awareness of potential monitoring thresholds.

**Basis for Opinion:**
- Documentary evidence of policy violation
- High-risk jurisdiction (Cayman Islands)
- No documented business purpose
- Descending amount pattern

---

### Finding 3: Ghost Employee Payments

**Opinion:** Based on my analysis, payments to employee E010 ("Ghost Employee") lack supporting documentation and exhibit characteristics of payroll fraud.

**Facts:**
- Four bi-weekly payments totaling $18,000
- Employee listed in Operations department
- No HR records, badge access, or email activity found

**Analysis:**
The absence of any corroborating evidence of employment, combined with the unusual employee name, strongly suggests fictitious payroll entries.

**Basis for Opinion:**
- Lack of employment verification
- No physical presence indicators
- Suspicious employee naming
- Pattern consistent with ghost employee schemes

## VI. Damages Calculation

### Quantified Losses

| Category | Amount | Confidence |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Ghost Employee | $18,000 | 85% |
| Offshore Transfers | $28,200 | 75% |
| **Total Quantified** | **$46,200** | 80% |

### Potential Additional Exposure

| Category | Estimated Range |
|----------|-----------------|
| Regulatory Penalties | $100,000 - $500,000 |
| Legal Fees | $50,000 - $150,000 |
| Remediation Costs | $25,000 - $75,000 |

---

## VII. Opinions

Based on my analysis, I hold the following opinions to a reasonable degree of professional certainty:

1. **Structuring Activity Occurred**: The cash deposit pattern constitutes structuring under federal law with probability exceeding 99%.

2. **Corporate Policy Violated**: Offshore wire transfers were made without required board approval.

3. **Ghost Employee Scheme Likely**: Employee E010 payments represent fraudulent disbursements with probability exceeding 85%.

4. **Internal Controls Deficient**: Multiple material weaknesses exist in the control environment.

5. **Financial Harm Quantifiable**: Minimum direct losses of $46,200 are attributable to identified schemes.
