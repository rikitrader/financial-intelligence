---

### II. Engagement & Scope (5 minutes)

**Q: What were you asked to do in this case?**
> I was retained to analyze financial records of Sample Corporation for the period January through February 2024.

**Q: What documents did you review?**
> Bank statements, general ledger, wire transfer logs, invoices, payroll records, and corporate policies.

**Q: What methodology did you employ?**
> Statistical analysis including Benford's Law, transaction tracing, entity resolution, and regulatory framework analysis.

---

### III. Finding 1: Currency Structuring (15-20 minutes)

**Q: Did you identify any concerning patterns in the bank records?**
> Yes. I identified a pattern of cash deposits that is consistent with currency structuring.

**Q: Please explain what you found.**
> On three consecutive days in January 2024, cash deposits were made of $9,999, $9,998, and $9,997. An additional deposit of $9,999 was made in February.

**[EXHIBIT 101 - Bank Statements]**

**Q: Why is this significant?**
> Banks are required to file Currency Transaction Reports for cash transactions over $10,000. Deliberately structuring transactions to avoid this threshold is a federal crime.

**Q: How likely is this pattern to occur by chance?**
> Less than one in ten thousand. The statistical probability of coincidence is negligible.

**Q: What is your opinion regarding these deposits?**
> It is my opinion that these deposits constitute structuring under 31 U.S.C. § 5324.

### IV. Finding 2: Offshore Transfers (15-20 minutes)

**Q: Did you identify any concerning wire transfers?**
> Yes. Three wire transfers totaling $28,200 were sent to an entity in the Cayman Islands.

**[EXHIBIT 102 - Wire Logs]**

**Q: What was concerning about these transfers?**
> Several factors: (1) Cayman Islands is a high-risk jurisdiction; (2) the amounts followed a descending pattern; (3) corporate policy required board approval that was not obtained.

**[EXHIBIT 103 - Corporate Policy]**

**Q: What is your opinion regarding these transfers?**
> The transfers violated corporate policy and exhibit characteristics of suspicious activity warranting further investigation.

### V. Finding 3: Ghost Employee (15-20 minutes)

**Q: Did you identify any issues with payroll records?**
> Yes. I identified payments to an individual listed as "Ghost Employee" totaling $18,000.

**[EXHIBIT 104 - Payroll Records]**

**Q: Were you able to verify this employee's existence?**
> No. I found no HR records, badge access logs, email activity, or any other evidence this person exists.

**Q: What is your opinion regarding these payments?**
> It is my opinion that these payments represent a ghost employee scheme, a common form of payroll fraud.

---

### VI. Damages (10 minutes)

**Q: Have you calculated the financial harm caused?**
> Yes. Direct quantifiable losses total at least $46,200.

**Q: How did you calculate this?**
> $18,000 in ghost employee payments plus $28,200 in unauthorized offshore transfers.

**Q: Are there additional potential losses?**

> 2. Offshore transfers violated corporate policy

> 4. Internal controls were materially deficient

**Q: What level of certainty do you hold these opinions?**
> I hold these opinions to a reasonable degree of professional certainty.

## Cross-Examination Preparation

### Anticipated Attack Areas

#### 1. Qualifications
**Attack:** "You're not a lawyer, are you?"
**Response:** "No, but forensic accounting analysis does not require a law degree. My role is to analyze financial data, not provide legal conclusions."

#### 2. Methodology
**Attack:** "Benford's Law has been criticized as unreliable."
**Response:** "Benford's Law is widely accepted in forensic accounting and has been admitted in numerous courts. I also corroborated findings with other methodologies."

#### 3. Alternative Explanations
**Attack:** "Couldn't these deposits be coincidental?"
**Response:** "The probability of coincidence is less than 0.01%. While theoretically possible, it is not reasonably likely."

#### 4. Data Limitations
**Attack:** "You only reviewed two months of data."
**Response:** "That is correct. My opinions are limited to the period analyzed. The patterns detected within that period remain significant."

#### 5. Ghost Employee
**Attack:** "You didn't personally interview anyone, did you?"
**Response:** "That is correct. However, I reviewed all available records, which showed no evidence of this employee's existence."
