## The Story

### Opening: The Trusted CFO

John Smith was the Chief Financial Officer of Sample Corporation. He had the keys to the kingdom - access to every bank account, every wire transfer, every payroll check. The company trusted him with everything.

But John Smith betrayed that trust.

### The Scheme: Three Days in January

It was a cold January morning when John Smith walked into the bank with the first envelope of cash. $9,999 - just one dollar below the amount that would trigger a federal report.

The next day, he returned. $9,998.

The third day. $9,997.

**This was no coincidence.**

The law requires banks to report cash transactions over $10,000. John Smith knew this. And he deliberately structured his deposits to stay one dollar below that threshold.

This is called "structuring." It's a federal crime. And the evidence will show that John Smith did it knowingly and intentionally.

### The Offshore Connection

But the cash deposits were just the beginning.

While no one was watching, John Smith was moving money out of the company - to a shell company in the Cayman Islands called "Offshore Holdings Ltd."

$9,500. Then $9,400. Then $9,300.

Each transfer just below internal monitoring thresholds. Each transfer without the board approval that company policy required.

**Where did that money go?** John Smith won't tell us. But we know it's gone - $28,200 sent to a tax haven with no paper trail.

### The Ghost Employee

And then there's the ghost.

Every two weeks, a paycheck went out to someone called "Ghost Employee" in the Operations department. $4,500 each time. $18,000 over just two months.

But here's the thing: **this person doesn't exist.**

No HR file. No badge access. No email account. No one has ever seen them.

Someone was collecting those checks. The evidence will show that John Smith, as CFO, approved every single one.

### The Lies

When we took John Smith's deposition under oath, we asked him about the cash deposits.

He said: *"I never saw those documents before today. I had no knowledge of any deposits under $10,000."*

But at trial, when confronted with the evidence, suddenly his story changed. Now he claims they were "legitimate business receipts" that "happened to be those amounts."

**He was lying then, or he's lying now.** Either way, you cannot trust his word.

### The Bottom Line

This case is about betrayal. A CFO who was supposed to protect the company instead stole from it.

The evidence will show:
- **$29,994** in structured cash deposits designed to evade federal reporting
- **$28,200** in unauthorized offshore transfers
- **$18,000** in payments to a fictional employee
- **Lies** under oath when confronted with the truth

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: "Just Under the Limit"

Every number in this case is "just under" some threshold.
- Cash deposits just under $10,000
- Wire transfers just under detection thresholds
- All of it designed to avoid scrutiny

**The jury instruction:** When you see someone repeatedly staying "just under the limit," that's not coincidence. That's calculation.

### Theme 2: "Follow the Money"

The evidence creates a clear path:
- Cash comes in (structured deposits)
- Cash goes out (offshore transfers)
- Fake employee collects more (ghost payroll)

**The jury instruction:** Ask yourself where each dollar went. If you can't trace it to a legitimate purpose, there's only one explanation.

### Theme 3: "The Story Changed"

John Smith's testimony is a moving target:
- In deposition: "I had no knowledge"
- At trial: "It was coincidental"
- With evidence: "I believed it was exempt"

**The jury instruction:** When someone's story keeps changing, it's because the truth doesn't help them.

## Closing Argument Framework

### Introduction
"Let me remind you of what John Smith told you under oath today..."

### The Evidence
"Three deposits. Three consecutive days. Each one just under $10,000. The math doesn't lie."

### The Law
"The judge will instruct you that structuring is illegal. You don't have to prove where the cash went - just that he deliberately avoided the reporting threshold."

### The Credibility
"He told you one story in his deposition. Another story at trial. And when confronted with the documents, yet another story. How can you believe anything he says?"

### The Ask
"We've proven our case. Now we ask you to hold John Smith accountable. Find for the plaintiff."
